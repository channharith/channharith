### Why, hello! ðŸ‘‹

Pronouns: He/Him

About me: Hello! My name is Channharith Sakun and I am a future programmer. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, ice skating and playing tennis. My favorite genre of video games are tactical games like Final Fantasy, Chess and League of Legends. Ice skating is definitely not my strongest but I like to skate, someday I want to learn how to figure skating. And lastly, I am rookie tennis player. I love learning new things and love talking to people. The stories and minds behind different people are interesting to me.


As of now, I am working on finishing my education which includes a bootcamp. I also am focusing right now on learning how to be a self-sufficient programmer and going back into school to finish my associates degree in engineering.

I am currently learning how to play guitar, how to draw and definitely learning how to cook. Cooking has been a skill I've put off for the longest.

For future projects, I would like to work on projects in either cybersecurity, cloud services or going back to school to become a college professor.

Fun facts about me include having large amounts of trivial knowledge, being an environmentalist, and using humor to cope.
